    "## Why You Should Learn Data Structures and Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you're pursuing a career in software development or data science, it's almost certain that you'll be asked to solve programming problems like *reversing a linked list* or *balancing a binary tree* in a technical interview or coding assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's well known, however, that you will almost never face these problems in your job as a software developer. So it's reasonable to wonder why such problems are asked in interviews and coding assessments. Solving programming problems demonstrates the following traits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can **think about a problem systematically** and solve it systematically step-by-step.\n",
    "2. You can **envision different inputs, outputs, and edge cases** for programs you write.\n",
    "3. You can **communicate your ideas clearly** to co-workers and incorporate their suggestions.\n",
    "4. Most importantly, you can **convert your thoughts and ideas into working code** that's also readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not your knowledge of specific data structures or algorithms that's tested in an interview, but your approach towards the problem. You may fail to solve the problem and still clear the interview or vice versa. In this course, you will learn the skills to both solve problems and clear interviews successfully."

    "\n",
    "Here's a systematic strategy we'll apply for solving problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.\n",
    "2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.\n",
    "3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English.\n",
